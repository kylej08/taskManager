# An overview

## A description of how it works
This program is a task registering system. The first screen presented is for a user to sign in. Once authenticated, the user then has various options (the type of options is dependent on whether or not the signed in user is the IT admin) to choose from.

Both the user and task information (including statistics about these users and tasks) are read from and written to text files.

The full menu list is as follows:
 1. register a new user (only available to admin)
 2. add a new task
 3. view all tasks
 4. view tasks related to the signed-in user
 5. generate statistics reports (only available to admin)
 6. display the statistics reports (only available to admin)
 7. exit the program

## Who will benefit?
Anybody new to python utilising console based output.

# Installation
Feel free to contact me via email to setup a call so that I can do a screen-share of the program.
If however, you prefer to do the setup on your own, below are the necessary steps:

1. Head over to python's main website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install python.
2. Download IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) for you to run the program.

# Contribution
Aspects of the program that can be improved:
1. A lightweight database (e.g SQLite) can be used to store all external information, instead of text files.
2. OOP can be implemented (e.g creating classes for objects, users etc).
3. A GUI can be created to make it more user-friendly.

# Licensing
There is no formal licensing for this program, however any distribution, modification and it being packaged to be sold is NOT permissible. Permission will be given by myself for you to download and use the program on your computer, however please remove it once you are done with it.
